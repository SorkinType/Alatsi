Alatsi is an original typeface designed by Spyros Zevelakis.

It is a semicondensed geometric sans design which feels familiar, calm, trustable and contemporary. It is a little lighthearted or casual in feeling as well. The contemporary feeling comes from the treatment of the terminals and the cheekily pointed V A W. The calmness from the modest x height.

Alatsi offers a wide range of figures which include oldstyle figures, numerators, denominators and fractions. It also offers case sensitive forms.

If you want to build fonts manually on your own computer:

* `make build` will produce font files.
* `make test` will run [FontBakery](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery)'s quality assurance tests.
* `make proof` will generate HTML proof files.

The proof files and QA tests are also available automatically via GitHub Actions - look at https://SorkinType.github.io/Alatsi.
