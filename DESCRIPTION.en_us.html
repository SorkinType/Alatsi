    Alatsi is an original typeface designed by Spyros Zevelakis.
</p>
<p>
    Eben Sorkin from Sorkin Type Co. art directed, kerned and added languages.

<p>
    It is a semicondensed geometric sans design which feels familiar, calm, trustable and contemporary. It is a little
    lighthearted or casual in feeling as well. The contemporary feeling comes from the treatment of the terminals and
    the cheekily pointed V A W. The calmness from the modest x height.
</p>
<p>
    Alatsi offers a wide range of figures which include oldstyle figures, numerators, denominators and fractions. It
    also offers case sensitive forms.
